            <div class="paragraph"> Omnifood is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, that specializes in indian food. It is one of the world largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales)  with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019. </div>

            <div class="paragraph">Omnifood was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Utah in 1952. Omnifood popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history, and his image remains widely used in Omnifood advertising to this day. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders, and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.</div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">There are 35 Omnifood outlets in India. The company has adapted the standard omnifood offerings to Indian tastes and the menu options in India include the Hot &amp; Crispy Chicken and Fiery Grilled bucket options, Chicken Zinger, Krushers, Rice Bowlz and the more recently launched 5-in-1 Meal Box.[84] The business was refranchised in October 2015 after Yum concluded a year-and-a-half-long exercise to reorganize its business under larger, well-capitalized franchisees. In this regard, about a third of its outlets, operated by several of its franchisees, have been sold to a newly formed entity—Sapphire Foods India Pvt. Ltd. The new entity is owned by a consortium of four private equity funds, led by Samara Capital. The other investors are CX Partners, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a fourth fund, said a top executive at the local arm of the American food company.</div>

         <div class="paragraph">The first Indian Omnifood was a two-storey outlet on the fashionable Brigade Road in Bangalore in June 1995.[86] According to journalist Michael White, the company could not have chosen a "more difficult venue for its maiden entrée into the country". Bangalore housed the headquarters of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one of the most influential, vocal and anti-foreign investment farmers' associations in the country. The first outlet suffered protests from anti-globalisation and environmental campaigners, as well as local farmers, who objected to the chain bypassing local producers.</div>
